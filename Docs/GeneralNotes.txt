1. Looks like spawning happens in GameRules.cpp | at least it's handles at some point there
2. ActorManager.cpp | looks like another place where spawning the player is controlled

[I believe the below files are where the main handling of MP spawning is implemented]
3. Multiplayer/GameRules dir. GameRulesMPSimpleSpawning.h/.cpp 
4. GameRulesMPSpawning.cpp/.h for more spawning control
