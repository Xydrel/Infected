This Document to describe the steps needed to get a up-to-date workspace to begin development on the project.

1. Download the SDK for CryEnging 3 from crydev.net. We are working with version 3.5.8
2. Log into github and clone the repo to the desired location on your HDD. I use <somedrive>:\DEV
3. unpack the contents of the CryEngine to the workspace directory, 
!!!!!DON'T OVERWRITE ANY FILES JUST THE DIRECTORIES!!!!!
4. Test to see if a compile will work in Visual Studio. 


NOTE:
Don't change the version of the compilers in the solution. They are set to version v100 and we need to keep 
them there for compat reasons with compiling the .dll
